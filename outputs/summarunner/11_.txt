an obsessive arsenal fan made his girlfriend sit a test quizzing her about his favourite football club .
marking her answers with red pen , she scored an impressive 43.5 out of 50 , to which he commented , ` well done saskia !
as a result , i will not be dumping you !
( lucky you ) ' .
saskia posted snaps of the test to her twitter account , @saskiaisabxlla , commenting ` boyfriend made me take an @arsenal exam ! '
with emoticons showing she did n't know whether to laugh or cry .
we do n't blame her .
saskia 's football fan boyfriend made her take an arsenal test and did n't dump her thanks to her a grade
the test took the form of a school exam , with multiple choice questions , tables to complete , and ` in your own words ... ' section .
there were even ` helpful ' instructions including ` read every question at least twice ' and ` check your answers if you have time at the end ' .
oh , and ` calculators may be used ' .
saskia scored an impressive 87 per cent , but according to her unnamed boyfriend 's feedback she ` could have performed better on q17 ' , needs to ` learn all player positions ' and should understand that ` tottenham are scum ' .
what does the ` fc ' in arsenal fc stand for ?
what is the nickname for arsenal fans ?
who is the current manager of arsenal ?
is the kit below ( see picture ) arsenal # s current home kit or away kit ?
name the starting 11 squad of this season in their relevant positions .
in your own words , explain why alexis sanchez is better than eden hazard .
who are our top 2 goalscorers of the season so far ?
what was the scoreline for the 2014 fa cup final vs hull city ?
what player scored the winning goal in the 204 fa cup final ?
why are arsenal the best team to ever grace english football ?
questions put to her in the test included :
` what was the scoreline for the 2014 fa cup final vs hull city ? '
` what player scored the winning goal in the 2014 fa cup final ? '
` name the starting 11 squad of this season in their relevant positions . '
she struggled to come up with the 11th player of the starting squad ( koscielny , defence , apparently ) and thought ozil was defence and wellbeck a midfielder , when in fact they are midfield and striker respectively .
she scored some decent points for her more creative answers .
asked to explain why alexis sanchez is better than eden hazard in her own words , she wrote , ` sanchez is buff , scores lots of goals , hazard is a p *** k , sanchez is chilean ' .
she got double marks for the hazard comment , but only got half a point for the last one .
saskia clearly knows how to keep her boyfriend happy , as she humoured his question of ` why are arsenal the best team to ever grace english football ? '
with the answer of ` they 've won many fa cups ' and ` thierry henry is a legend ' .
however , when she got an answer wrong , her examiner wrote the correct answer in capitals and drew an angry face .
this man clearly means business .
saskia struggled to name all 11 players of the starting squad and got confused on the player positions
saskia 's boyfriend drew an angry face when she got a question wrong - this man means business
saskia kept her boyfriend happy with creative answers to his questions , and got double marks for some ...
he was impressed with the end result , though , grading her an ` a ' and rewarding her by not ending their relationship .
and they say romance is dead .
comments generally hailed the man as a ` legend ' and fellow football fans were impressed with saskia 's knowledge .
some twitter users hailed the unnamed boyfriend who tested saskia on her arsenal knowledge as a legend
scoring 87 % , football fans were impressed with saskia , claiming her as ` proper gf material '
may men felt inspired , with @lewisxweeked warning his girlfriend to ` get revising '
indeed , @gstarrs85 congratulated saskia and stating that she was ` proper gf material ' .
plenty of men felt inspired by the post , with @lewisxweekes telling his girlfriend @laycijade to ` get revising ' and @digsxiii crying ` where can i get this test from ? '
others , though , felt that the boyfriend had taken things a tad too far .
@gunsaured11 stated ` football fans are nuts ' , and @dcslfc commented ` imagine actually broadcasting that your boyfriend is the biggest biff-head ever to the world . '
we reckon it was a bit of fun and he would n't really have dumped her if she 'd failed ... at least we like to think that 's the case .
trimothy wants to put his girlfriend to the test , although apparently ca n't be bothered to create his own exam
eduardo claims ` football fans are nuts ' despite appearing to be one as he holds what looks suspiciously like the fa cup in his hands ...
some thought saskia 's boyfriend took things too far with @dcslfc creatively naming him a ` biff-head '
