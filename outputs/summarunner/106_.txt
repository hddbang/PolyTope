speaking to the daily telegraph , mourinho admitted that he has a strong faith in god .
` i believe totally , clearly .
every day i pray ; every day i speak with him .
i do n't go to the church every day , not even every week .
i go when i feel i need to .
and when i 'm in portugal , i always go . '
the former real madrid manager said he only prays for things in is personal life , never about chelsea .
` i can say the reality is i never go to the church to speak with him about football .
despite his intensely arrogant persona on the sideline , mourinho claims that he is a good person .
and i think i am .
i do n't have problems with family or friends .
i am a good family person ; i am a good friend .
i try to support people that i do n't even know .
` do i make mistakes ?
my professional area is not only very competitive -- it is competitive and emotional and [ you must ] push people for a certain kind of behaviour -- absolutely , yes .
but the professional life is only part of a person ; a person is much more than that . '
