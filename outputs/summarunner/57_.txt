tragedy : carwyn scott-howell ( left ; right ) fell to his death while on holiday with his mother ceri , nine-year-old sister antonia and brother gerwyn , 19 , in the alps
footprints in the snow eventually led police to his body , investigators revealed last night .
they also described how the boy 's mother cari , 44 , desperately tried to find her missing son .
in a moving tribute , carwyn 's family described how he ` made life full of laughter with never a dull moment ' .
` seven years is too short a time to be an angel in the sky , ' they added .
` carwyn was an adorable , caring person who gave so much love .
the family can not explain their feeling of utter devastation with a vast void in their hearts . '
carwyn , from talybont-on-usk in wales , was said to have been a ` very competent skier and snowboarder ' who had started skiing at the age of three .
the family said they had spent ` the most happy ski holiday together ' in the resort of flaine in the days before the tragedy stuck .
they were enjoying their last run of the day when the boy 's sister antonia , nine , lost her ski on a jump and carwyn pressed on ahead .
his mother stopped to help her daughter and continued to the bottom of the piste .
but carwyn -- who modelled himself on the tv adventurer bear grylls -- was nowhere to be seen .
mrs scott-howell returned to their hotel believing her son had made his own way back , but returned to the mountain when she found he was n't there .
pierre-yves michau , the judge heading the investigation , said yesterday : ` she asked everyone if they had seen him . '
it is believed carwyn left the piste and entered woodland because he had spotted the resort through the trees .
taking off his skis , he continued on foot as he hurried to get there .
police chief michel ollagnon confirmed that officers had been led to the boy 's body by footprints in the snow .
he said the final steps were broken up by ` sliding marks ' where carwyn had tackled the sharper inclines on his backside .

mr ollagnon said : ` we think he was attracted by the ski station that he could see below .
we think he was heading for the resort . '
police last night said carwyn 's body is ready to be repatriated but his family remained in the alps .
back in wales , his friends have written in a condolence book on display at brecon cathedral : ` miss you in class .
we will miss you always . '
alongside the book is a picture of carwyn dressed in his karate kit .
at the youngster 's school in brecon , head teacher emyr jones said pupils were devastated , adding : ` we are all grieving . '
he described carwyn as a ` lively , likeable pupil who will be greatly missed ' at ysol y bannau school .
county councillor liam fitzpatrick said the community would rally behind the scott-howells , who are well known for their award-winning farm shop .
he added : ` it 's horrendous .
a tragic , tragic accident . '
carwyn lived with his parents at their farmhouse in the village near the brecon beacons .
he is said to have loved the mountains and helping on the farm where he had grown up .
the family often attended food fairs across the country and david cameron was pictured buying a scotch egg from the family 's stand last year .
