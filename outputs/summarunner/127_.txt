` it 's a superstition that i 've done all my life and i 'm going to keep it that way , ' grealish told the bbc .
he appears not to wear shinpads on first glance , but does in fact use a children 's size .
` a few referees have tried telling me but i 've got to keep it like that , ' grealish added .
` i have n't had a kick on my shin yet and hopefully not any time soon . '
his first league start for the club came in the pulsating 3-3 draw against qpr on tuesday , but the republic of ireland under 21 international was glad to get it out of the way .
grealish was pleased to have finally made his first premier league start for villa against qpr
` it was a bit of a tough game to get my first start , in a big relegation scrap , but i 'm pleased even if i 'm not happy about how the game ended up , ' he added .
` i try and see it as any other football match but it 's nice that the gaffer has got that faith in me and hopefully i can try to get a few more starts before the end of the season .
` he said i deserve my start which is nice to hear and it really gives me a bit of a boost . '
