on tuesday she set herself on fire using kerosene , according to ndtv , to the shock of her brother , who doused her with water .
he told the broadcaster : ` when i woke up , i saw her in flames ... i poured water on her to put out the flames . '
the girl was screaming for help , according to a neighbour .
the accused men have been arrested .
there is a heightened sensitivity to the issue of sexual assault in india at the moment after officials last month banned india 's daughter , a documentary about the gang rape and murder of an indian student in delhi .
recent attacks in india have resulted in street protests with many calling for more protection for women
officials said the documentary would cause further disorder if it was shown , following a number of protests and incidents of vigilante justice in the country .
the documentary explained the brutal rape and murder of 23-year-old student jyoti singh , who was attacked on a bus when she returned home from the cinema .
one of the six men convicted of the attack , bus driver mukesh singh , was interviewed in prison and told researchers that had jyoti not fought back she would not have been killed .
her death led to protests throughout india and outraged the world .
last month an angry mob were seen on video footage beating a man to death in the street who was accused of raping and murdering an 11-year-old girl .
video footage has emerged of the brutal prolonged attack on the 18-year-old , which was watched by a jeering 1,000-strong crowd in nagaland in eastern india .
ibo cha was said to have been beaten for an hour before he died of his injuries .
the footage was shot in september last year after the girl 's body was found in woodland , enraging locals .
but it only came to light after earlier this year alleged rapist syed sarif khan was kidnapped from prison and dragged through the streets of the same area .
he was then stripped naked and beaten to death .
he was accused but not convicted of raping a 19-year-old female student multiple times .
later nagaland government said he was innocent .
jyoti singh pandey , a physiotherapy student , was gang raped as she travelled on a bus .
the 23-year-old suffered in hospital for 13 days from her injuries before she died .
vinay sharma , 20 , akshay thakur , 28 , pawan gupta , 19 , and mukesh singh , 26 , were all sentenced to death for her rape .
ram singh , co-accused and widely considered the leader of the group , was found dead in his cell .
a minor also found guilty was sentenced to three years in a reformatory institution .
her death sparked angry protests in india and internationally about misogyny in the country .
the attention forced judges to prioritise the case and the lawyer 's association in saket reportedly refused to defend the perpetrators .
