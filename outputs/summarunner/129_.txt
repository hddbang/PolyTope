hong kong ( cnn ) six people were hurt after an explosion at a controversial chemical plant in china 's southeastern fujian province sparked a huge fire , provincial authorities told state media .
the plant , located in zhangzhou city , produces paraxylene ( px ) , a reportedly carcinogenic chemical used in the production of polyester films and fabrics .
the blast occurred at an oil storage facility monday night after an oil leak , though local media has not reported any toxic chemical spill .
five out of six people were injured by broken glass and have been sent to the hospital for treatment , xinhua news agency reported .
more than 600 firefighters were sent to battle the blaze and the fire is now under control , the zhangzhou fire department wrote on their official microblogging account tuesday morning .
residents living close to the plant had heard the explosion and took to weibo to post photos of the fire .
one user wrote that he heard a loud blast and felt slight tremors .
the plant was hit by another explosion in july 2013 , although there were no reports of casualties or toxic leaks at the time .
though demonstrations are illegal in china , the construction of px plants has sparked protests , which have occasionally turned violent , in several cities in recent years .
the zhangzhou plant was slated for xiamen -- a densely populated city in the southeast of the country .
however , it provoked an angry backlash in 2007 due to pollution concerns and prompted the local government to relocate the factory to its current , more remote location .
