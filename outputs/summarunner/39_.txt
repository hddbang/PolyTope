one teenager who was born with foetal alcohol syndrome is 15-year-old niamh brown .
she needs help getting dressed , has no sense of danger and will never be able to live independently .
niamh was three when her adoptive parents julia and simon first noticed something was wrong .
she stuggled at playschool , having difficulty holding a pencil and paying attention .
two years later , at the age of five , niamh was diagnosed with foetal alcohol syndrome from her birth mother 's drinking .
in 2007 , julia and simon set up the foetal alcohol spectrum disorder trust to help others .
other medical issues associated with alcohol consumption during pregnancy include problems with the liver , kidneys and heart , cerebral palsy , sight loss and epilepsy .
pregnant women are advised by the government not to drink alcohol .
if they do , the maximum consumption recommended is up to two units no more than twice a week .
but ms mitchell believes the guidance should be changed so that women are advised not to drink at all during pregnancy .
