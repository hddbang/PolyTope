` i do n't think he 's happy with his performance this year -- and nor am i , ' said pellegrini .
` he does n't need a break . '
toure , who has two years left on a Â£ 220,000-a-week deal , has come in for criticism amid the collapse of city 's premier league defence .
but pellegrini , who faces questions over his own future , said the 31-year-old would be backed .
` he 's a very important player and he will have my support until the end of the season , ' he said .
city , who have taken just 18 points from the last available 39 , take on sam allardyce 's side knowing that defeat will leave fifth-placed liverpool with the chance to close the gap to one point with victory at west brom next weekend .
city will also face the hammers without captain vincent kompany , who could miss the rest of the campaign with a muscle injury .
with his manager in the firing line , city goalkeeper joe hart insisted the players should take responsibility .
` people have been disappointed in their own performances , ' said the england no 1 .
` we 've let the manager down a few times and we 've baffled ourselves because we feel like we 've got the quality to beat anyone and that 's not been the case . '

hart added that pellegrini retained the backing of the dressing room .
` he 's been great , ' hart said .
` he 's hard , he kind of says it how it is and you ca n't ask for much more than that from a manager . '
pellegrini , however , said : ` the players have responsibility but i choose the players . '
meanwhile sam allardyce has warned aaron cresswell not to make the same mistake as others amid interest from chelsea and manchester city .

allardyce believes the 25-year-old is an attractive prospect after a fine season at west ham and because he can help clubs fill homegrown player quotas .
` jack rodwell and scott sinclair spent time at city but did not play a great deal , ' allardyce wrote in his evening standard column .
` the decision for a player like sinclair is would he be willing to join another club in a permanent deal if it meant less money ? '
