a baby girl was found in the bin inside the ladies ' toilet at a chinese burger bar
a woman who had been seen visiting the toilet was established to be the mother and was arrested
staff at the restaurant said they saw the woman going into the toilet and noticed that she 'd stayed there for a long time .
after she came out , she went back to her seat , sitting there without speaking a word .
` after we discovered the baby girl , we checked the cctv footage , we found this woman likely to be the mother of the baby , so we called the ambulance as well as the police , ' one worker said .
the woman , yuan yen , 34 , was found to have blood on her when she was approached .
she refused to look at her baby or talk to police , who discovered her identity by looking through her purse .
workers at the restaurant said yuan yen had returned to her table and sat ` in a trance '
she was arrested after receiving medical attention and faces charges of neglect
police insisted she have emergency treatment and took her to the same hospital as her daughter , where she refused to see doctors .
a worker at the fast food outlet said : ` the mother was in shock herself and was just sitting there in a trance .
` there was blood all over her shirt and she had her head bowed in shame .
i think she was just traumatised . '
cops tried to locate her relatives but were unable to contact anybody as her phone had no credit and she had no local addresses on her .
she was later transferred to the police station where she is facing charges of neglect .
the infant , weighing 2.6 kg ( 5.7 lb ) , was declared to be healthy after being checked over by doctors .
