yuck : gemma the pit bull was filmed at home in california being fed some treats , but in a bid to trick her , her owner throws a broccoli spear into the mix not a broccoli fan : immediately the canine pulls a look of disgust as she chomps on the vegetable - she then proceeds to spit it out on the floor when she 's not filling her face , other videos show gemma enjoys sleeping and hanging out with her human family . let 's hope the two children she lives with do n't follow her lead
