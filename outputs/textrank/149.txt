but the property comes with a catch , not only is it in dire need of renovation , ( such as in one of its bedrooms , pictured ) the home has just three years left on the lease 
the cost for £ 575,000 on a three year lease would work out at £ 191,000 per year , or £ 15,000 per month - which is around the going rate for renting a three-bedroom flat in the area , plus renovation works which are needed , such as in the living room ( pictured )
