brown is determined not to suffer an extended break - so will not rush himself back to action ahead of time .
` it was just after the france game , there was n't one incident where i was dizzy or concussed , but after the game i just did n't feel quite right , ' said brown .
` i had a headache the sunday and monday , so just being cautious with it , i do n't want to get into the situation where you get a few knockouts or something .
` you do n't want to be into a situation where you 're out for a long time like johnny sexton or geoff parling or something like that .
` so with what 's coming up at the end of the year , everyone 's being cautious , and i 'm being cautious as well .

brown was knocked out cold in england 's 47-17 victory over italy at twickenham in the second round of rbs 6 nations action in february .
the harlequins flyer had hoped to recover in time to face ireland in dublin on march 1 , but pulled out in the build-up .
brown said increased awareness of the symptoms of concussion , driven by players undergoing world rugby online modules , helped him realise he would not be ready to face ireland .

` learning about all the symptoms was massive , ' said brown , speaking for land rover 's ` we deal in real ' campaign .
` i pulled out on the tuesday before the ireland game with the symptoms , and i could maybe have tried to carry on with training , but being aware of the symptoms was important .
` so just knowing the dangers of the long and short-term dangers , how important it is to be honest and how serious it can be , i think those are the main things i took from the online courses .
` after the france game i had a headache and could ( have ) easily thought " it 's sarries , it 's wembley and i 'll give it a go " , but we 're so clued up on it now that i do n't think anyone would risk it .
brown ( right ) says he suffered a headache after playing in england 's clash against france last month
` if i can do it , pulling out of england-ireland , the biggest game of the six nations at that point , then i think anyone can do it , and should do it .
` now i 've been through it i would definitely talk to team-mates urging them not to play on if i thought they were showing symptoms .
` at the time you think it 's a pain but now i 'm very glad i took those online modules .
` it 's just not worth pushing through . '
land rover ambassador mike brown was speaking at the launch of ` we deal in real ' , land rover 's rugby world cup 2015 campaign that champions people at the heart and soul of the game by putting grassroots clubs on the global stage .
