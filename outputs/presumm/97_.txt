the survey of 1,100 adults by vehicle leasing firm osv , found that 31 per cent of men have never washed their own car , with only 12 per cent of those that do saying they do it regularly .
meanwhile only five per cent of those surveyed said that had ever asked their children to wash the car , as a way for them to earn extra pocket money .
factors behind the decline vary from shops now opening on a sunday and more live football on tv , meaning more people put off the chore at the weekend .

audis , toyotas and bmws are most likely to be washed by their owners and range rovers , peugeots and mercedes least often .
osv spokesman andrew kirkley said : ` a lot of us remember seeing our streets full of men cleaning their cars every sunday .
it was a national tradition .
` but let 's face it , we do n't have as much time any more , the cars are bigger and even the kids do n't seem to want to earn a bit of extra money doing it for us either .
` on top of that , there is now plenty of choice out there if you want to put the car through an automated machine or get a gang of enthusiastic guys to do it for you fairly cheaply . '
