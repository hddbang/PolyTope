nicholson was shot in the back by officer miguel gutierrez and is in pain but he says he and his friends feel lucky to be alive .
nicholson was standing next to the unidentified teenager who was holding the replica of the gun .
` jamar is really lucky to be alive .
with respect to the other kids , they are lucky as well that they were n't hit .
it does n't appear that the officer who shot used a lot of discrimination with where he aimed the pistol , ' jamar 's attorney herbert hayden told yahoo news .
the gun that officers thought was real had an orange tip indicating that it was fake .
another attorney john w. harris who is representing nicholson and his friend 17-year-old jason huerta is arguing that nicholson and his friend posed no threat to police officers or themselves .
` the lapd shot first and then asked questions later , ' harris said .
the lapd says that at 7.45 am on february 10 , officers saw a teen holding what appeared to be a gun and they claim they told him to drop it .
: one of the teens present at the shooting was holding this fake gun with an orange tip that lapd say they thought was real
` officers ordered him to drop the weapon multiple times .
the individual ignored the officer 's commands , ' a police news release reads .
attorney hayden said that had a camera been rolling , the lapd 's story may have been expressed differently .
` the police department 's officers have each other 's backs .
if there is no camera rolling , they are free to construe the facts how they see fit , ' hayden said .
` it 's so bizarre in this incident that testimony of the people we interviewed is so drastically different from the story the lapd has been pumping out since this first started , ' he added .
hayden said that the officer who shot nicholson , miguel gutierrez , also shot and killed a dog in 2008 when responding to a traffic collision .
both nicholson and huerta said they feel traumatized by what happened to them .

nicholson said he had to miss school as a result of the shooting and said that he felt tremendous pain from his injuries .
` i see a cop and i get nervous , ' he said .
` i 've never really looked at police in a certain way , until that day . '
nicholson and huerta say they have never been in trouble with the law before .
` you can check our records , ' huerta insisted .
` that 's a bad way to meet officers , ' nicholson said .
` got off on the wrong foot , ' huerta said .
officer gutierrez has returned to full duty since the incident , though it remains under investigation .
