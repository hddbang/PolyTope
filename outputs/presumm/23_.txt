` a big set of balls .
i 've just got to come forward and go out there and dominate him , ' he said .
` machida likes to run around and dance and do his thing .
i 've just got to cut him off , slowly progress and be the bull .
he tries to be the matador -- sometimes you 've got to play one role or the other and this is the time to be the bull and slowly progress , put him in a bad spot and make him fight my fight .
` i 've seen little things that he does n't like -- there 's plenty of other fights too that i 've seen that show a lot of holes and areas where i can take advantage of .
` you see fights where guys stand in the middle ground too long -- i 've just got to make him think about everything .
i 'm a true mixed martial artist ; i have everything to my game .
he 's got to think about me taking him down , and then my kicks and my punches and everything that i bring to the table .
` machida has got a very small avenue to win this fight on the feet .
other than that , my avenue is quite big comparably to his .
he does n't really have much of a chance on the ground .

` i 'll be operating at a different frequency than him -- he does n't have the hip movement and the speed to keep up with me . '
and while rockhold afforded machida his respect , he has no plans to let it get in the way of victory .
` i think there is a mutual respect between machida and me -- i respect what he does , ' he said .
` he 's one of the best in the game and has been for a long , long time .
` he 's right here at the top , where he 's been for the whole of his career .
he 's a martial artist -- he lives by the code .
a lot of people love his fighting style , a lot of people hate his fighting style , but you have to respect his fighting style .
` i respect what he does and i like a lot of the things he does .
but at the same time , i 'm going to go out there and show him my style and dominate .
` i 've been running marathons every day so i 'm ready to go in there and chase him down . '
rockhold 's last victory came against michael bisping last november in australia
machida is also coming off the back of a victory , against cb dollaway in brazil
machida , meanwhile , is confident he can upset rockhold and earn himself a title shot .
` i think if i apply my style , my technique , i can stop luke , you know , ' he said .
` if i can do my strategy , i can win the fight .
` i know there was another fight in line for the title shot - jacare vs yoel romero -- but now , whoever wins out of me and luke -- deserves a title shot i think .
` i can see a couple of weaknesses in luke but it 's hard to say before the fight , it 's hard to foresee the fight .
i have to be there to feel the fight - to see any mistakes he makes .
` i am very well prepared for this fight .
i had eight weeks of camp and i had great training .
glover [ teixeira ] was there and many , many other fighters .
so i am feeling very well , very calm , and i think i can do a great job . '
