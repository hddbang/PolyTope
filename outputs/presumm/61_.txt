only a week ago , sterling held nothing back with his stunning interview after rejecting a new £ 100,000-a-week deal at liverpool .
he also sensationally revealed that he was flattered to be linked with arsenal to cast a huge question mark over his future .
but liverpool are adamant that the 20-year-old , who has two years left to run on his contract , will not be quitting this summer and are putting their shirt on him to stay .
one fan shouted ` make sure we see you in that next season ' at sterling , and the heckle was greeted with applause .
sterling told an expectant audience : ` the fans are great .
it 's a massive boost when you come out of the changing room and hear them sing that song .
you ca n't get better than that .
while players also turned their attention to the fa cup semi-final against aston villa at wembley next weekend .
` it 's special to play at wembley , especially because it 's my home town , ' sterling said .
and sturridge added : ` winning the fa cup would be huge for everyone - players , fans and staff .
we all want to have some success and we hope it 's this season .
winning the cup could be a platform for more success in the future .
` it 's great to play in front of these fans .
it 's an unbelievable feeling .
it 's a cliche but it 's true , they are our 12th man .
every week we try to get 3 points for the fans .
they mean a lot to us . '

brazilian coutinho was the hero in midweek as he helped brendan rodgers ' side bounce back from last weekend 's bruising barclays premier league defeat by arsenal with a fine finish to book liverpool a semi-final showdown with aston villa at wembley next sunday .
although departing captain steven gerrard wo n't be around to model liverpool 's new kit next season , his dream of bowing out in the fa cup final on his birthday , may 31 , remains alive .
the new shirt features all white branding -- the new balance logo , the liverbird and the standard chartered logo , whilst there is an all-new style of collar .
skrtel said : ` it 's a great design , i just hope it will bring us some luck and success . '
