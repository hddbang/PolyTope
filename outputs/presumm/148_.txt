ian , who is single , and a vehicle image inspector , from leicester , says that his obsession with the supernatural began at a very young age .
` it started when i was a kid and i was looking into the loch ness monster and ghosts .
` i went on a couple of ghost walks and then went on a hunt .
it got me hooked . '
the Â£ 50 haunted dolls , which ian gets from jayne harris , a professional in paranormal activity , are said to contain the spirits of people who have passed on .
jayne keeps the dolls for around six months to get an idea of their personalities before selling them on .
ian says that he always goes to jayne for the dolls because that way he can be sure of their authenticity .
` i know that i can trust her , ' he says .
` if i bought them from ebay then there 's no guarantee that they 're actually haunted and i could just be being ripped off .
` jayne is able to give me a bit of background about the dolls but i enjoy learning about them myself .

although he is fond of his whole collection ian definitely has a favourite : annabel , a doll who he believes is haunted by the spirit of a seven-year-old girl who drowned while playing with her brother .
ian says that each of his dolls has their own story and he often asks others to try and figure out what might have happened to them .
ian said : ` i take the dolls with me to events that i host and get people to guess their stories .
` if someone guesses three things that we already know correctly then they get some money off .
` one lady said she could sense an ` annie ' so i went to get annabel .
she said she 'd died and felt trapped .
` as soon as she picked up the doll she said she felt soaking wet , and that she knew annabel had drowned . '
